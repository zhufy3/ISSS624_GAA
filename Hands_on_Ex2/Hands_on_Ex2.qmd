# Overview

In this chapter, we will learn what is spatial autocorrelation, Localised Geospatial Analysis, Cluster and Outlier Analysis, and Hot Spot and Cold Spot Areas Analysis.

## 1. What is Spatial Autocorrelation

-   Tobler's First Law of Geolgraphy:
    Everything is related to everything else,\
    but near things are more related than distant things

-   Spatial Dependence

    Spatial relationship of variable values.

-   Spatial Autocorrelation

    Measured as spatial dependence in a correlation of random variables. Positive Autocorrelation; Negative Autocorrelation.

-   Detecting Spatial Clusters and Outliers: Moran's I; Geary's c; z-score & p-value.
